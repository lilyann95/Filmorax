# React

- This is a react website for watching latest movies. I have used a TMDB public API to get the movies.

- Appwrite as the database for storing the mostly searched movies.

- React Font Awesome Icons and tailwindCss for the appearance.

- I still have more ideas for the website which I will add with time. This is my first deployment
